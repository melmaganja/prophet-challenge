# prophet-challenge

In this assignment, data from Mercado Libre was used to look at the companyâ€™s financial and user data. In this assignment, Prophet was utilized to make predictions about future traffic searches 80 days in the future. This was the first-time using Prophet, as well as visualizations to depict information. 
This assignment highlighted some financial coding that I was previously unaware of such as pct_change and .corr. Every assignment offers new challenges and enhances my learning of coding.
